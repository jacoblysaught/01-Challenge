# 01-Challenge

This assingment was meant to better understand semantic elements and how much more accessible and descriptive they are rather than just the <div> tags.
I started off by changing the title of the page to make it more descriptive and accurate to the pages' content then worked through the <div> tags replacing them to be semantic.
I next added some alt attributes to the images for accessibility and fixed a link on the site to make sure they funcion correctly and send you to the right spot of the page.
With that, I changed some element tags in CSS to match the semantic changes and added some comments as well to keep the stylesheet neat and organized.
